# MCP Fetch Weather

A simple and functional implementation of a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/sdk) server, using the official SDK.

This project exposes a tool (`fetch-weather`) that allows you to obtain the current weather of a city, ideal as a basic example to learn about the protocol and communication between LLMs and custom tools.
